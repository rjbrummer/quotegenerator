<h1>Customisable PHP Quote Generator</h1>

This is a customiseable quote generator created using an indexed array and some php code.
This php code randomises which item on the array is output to the user.
The user needs to click a button to receive a different output.
This output occurs as a result of the screen refreshing, thus asking the php to output a different randomised item.

This example models how to use it with life quotes.

However, the array can be fully customised, located at the top of index.php. Simply substitute the text, phrases, numbers...etc you want randomly output on your website in the array.
